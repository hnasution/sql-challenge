Module 9 Challenge

Background
To do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

Data Modelling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables using QuickDBD http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

Data Engineering
1. Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
2. Import each CSV files into its corresponding SQL table
    * When importing importing employees csv files, there was error message 'date/time field value out of range: '7/25/1953', related to datestyle setting. 
    Postgress accepted dates in format 'YYYY-MM-DD" whilst CSV files date format was 'MM/DD/YYYY'. 
    Although the datestyle in Postgress was set to ISO, MDY, importing csv file was unsuccessful.
    Changed datestyle in postgress from ISO, MDY to ISO DMY
    After some modification and changeing the date format in CSV file, re-imported finally successfull. 
    * There was also error when importing dept_emp csv file. 
    I identified duplicate entries in the dept_emp, I made assumption that the duplicates are on the second line.
    To fix the importing duplicate error message, I decided to delete the second line on each of the duplicate entries before importing the csv file.
    Re-importing file was succesfull,
